### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


"I've been working on a small application where I'll introduce myself for a while now. For the main page, I prefer to use a design with scrolling stars, giving it an artificial intelligence touch. In the background, I've made elements like the logo, content, and avatar dynamic using controller actions in Asp.Net Core, and you can change them from the admin panel, among other standard features.

The most exciting part for me is the WEB3 side, as you'll see in the video. Currently, I'm only connecting a Metamask wallet to fetch the balance and wallet name, but the most interesting part is retrieving transaction history. To achieve this, I obtained a free API key from Etherscan and used JavaScript to fetch the transaction history of the connected wallet. However, the data comes in a JSON file and isn't very user-friendly, so I made some modifications in JavaScript to ensure the correct results. Additionally, I used the Math class to make values like transaction date, fee, and spent ETH more readable and accurate.

In the future, I might create an NFT or a token that can be minted. This project can evolve into a platform to showcase my skills, or it might take a different direction. I'm leaving some of the code I've written in the comments.

Best regards!"
